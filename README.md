Play the classic bingo game with a JavaScript flavor

Last weekend I passed some time with my nephew trying to teach him some JavaScript coding principles. After 40 or 50 minutes we got this, it's a script to play BINGO using any device, and because the code uses simple CSS, plain JavaScript and the voice synthetizer API to say or "sing" every picked number, it was a try to do something that catch the interest of my nephew on programming.

It was a funny time with him, and I think the result is good enought to present it to you now. I hope you can enjoy it as much as we enjoyed coding it!

PS: All the original script was coded using Vanilla JavaScript, to publish it I decided add to it my own Vue dialogs custom component just for some aesthetical considerations.
