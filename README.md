Play the classic bingo game with a JavaScript flavor

Last weekend I passed some time with my nephew trying to teach him some JavaScript coding principles.
After 40 or 50 minutes we got this, it's a script to play BINGO, and because the code uses
the SpeechSynthesisUtterance to say or "sing" every picked number, my nephew is now a little bit interested on programming.
It was a funny time with my nephew, and I think the result is good enought to present it to you now,
I hope you can enjoy it as much I enjoyed coding it!

PS: All the original script was coded in pure JavaScript, to public it I decided add to it
my own Vue dialogs custom component just for some aesthetical considerations.
